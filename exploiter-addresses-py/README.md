# Exploiter Addresses Detection Bot

## Description

This bot detects transactions that involve known exploiter addresses.

Known Exploiter Addresses Source:

* [Luabase's](https://luabase.com/) `tags` table which includes addresses and wallet tags labeled as `exploit`, `heist`, and `phish/hack` from [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/labelcloud).

The bot queries the `tags` table with the following SQL statement every 1 minute and maintains a local csv of known exploiter addresses.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT address as banned_address, tag as wallet_tag, concat('etherscan-', label, '-list') as data_source
FROM tags WHERE label in ('heist', 'exploit', 'phish-hack')
```
