TRAINING_WINDOW_IN_BUCKET_SIZE = 12*24*7  # recommended to cover training period during which the periodicity can be observed, so in case of a bucket_window_in_minutes, 12 * 24 * 7 = 1 week period. This is the lookback period the time series model will be built on. It is recommended to at least have 7 days so weekly periodicity can be taken into account.
