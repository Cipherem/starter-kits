0xa30669c9ddb1cbf1594a923f7eccac8ce0eee7fa,1,Not a TP (the potenital hacker was not approved but somehow invoked the transfer from function)
0x8d5064fd1b1e74405050ba297239bc2aff28ef1b,1,This is clearly an FP. "Targets" are being drained several times by the same EOA. Also all targets are funded by crypto.com

0x7ace242f32208d836a2245df957c08547059bf45,137,Scammer "stealed" several times by the same "hacker". Also between steals, it exists funding so it doesn have much sense.

0x663862776c7879116d8afc5e559548c6723eecfd,1, "Targets" are not fully drained. Also "targets" are sending to the hacker, they execute more ETH tx to other adddresses 
0x7b704077d855c5da55729adffec78cd79ff0ced4,1, Doesn't seem like a TP
0x7e3e08d573dd0844dc2e623bdbd4ec87c54629f6,1, targets are transferring more than once to the hacker
0x9febd061f5955ecce02857f9f02210f1c937bcf8,1, Liklely FP - All targets funded by binance or OKX, then interacted with ZKsynkEra - Seems more like an airdrop hunter
